1. Create a git repository in github.com.

2. Go to the directory in the command prompt, where you want to publish in github.

cd/your_directory_name

3. Us the below command to initialise the local directory as git repository.

git init

4. Add all the files in the local directory to staging using the below command.

git add .

This command stages all teh files in the directory, ready for commit.

5. You can now commit the staged files using the below command. It is explanatory and helpful. The below command commits all the files present to the local git repository.

git commit -m 'my first commit'

6. Add remote repositry url

* Now, copy the remote repositry URL provided by github to you when you published your repositry on Github.

* Now we will add the copied URL for your GitHub repository as remote repository using the code below.

	git remote add origin https://github.com/sachinarya9/python_concepts.git

* This command makes our github repository as a remote, which helps us making push our local repository changes.

7. Push local repository to Github

* In the las step, use the below command to push the local repository to github. It will upload the file or project on github.

	git push origin master

* If you use -u in the command, it will remember your preferences for remote and branch and you can simply use the command git push next time.

git push -u origin master

8. To add a single file to the git repository.

1. git add file_name.txt # this adds file to the staging area.

2. git commit -m "commited file_name.txt". # this commits the file to the local repository

3. if our origin(master branch) is declared then run below command

      git push origin master

this will add the new fe to our Git repository.
